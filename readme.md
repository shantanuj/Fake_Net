This repository contains our implementation for our current approach to tackling Fake News. It includes:
1) A scraper to obtain trusted Bloomberg and Guardian articles.
2) A dataset specific model to compute fakeness adapted from: www.github.com/genyunus/Detecting_Fake_News
3) A stance model to compute stance of an article with respect to other articles.
4) Combination model to compute fakeness score by including information from previous two models and computed domain reputation frequency. 
5) The repo will be updated with an exciting new approach soon. Stay tuned :)
